        <h2>✨ <u>Personality</u></h2>
        <ul>
            
              <li> <p>Izuku is a very timid, reserved, and polite boy, frequently overreacting to abnormal situations with exaggerated expressions.</p></li>

              <li><p>Due to years of being looked down on by Katsuki for lacking a Quirk, he is initially portrayed as insecure, tearful, vulnerable, and non-expressive. </p></li>

              <li><p>Izuku gradually matures into a more confident and brave person who's always eager to prove his worth as a hero, eventually developing 
                  <br>strong leadership skills,which combined with his passion and strategic abilities, have turned him into a central figure within Class 1-A alongside Katsuki.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>Izuku is a quite diligent and strong-willed student, being extremely (and sometimes scarily) enthusiastic about topics related to heroes.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>His dream drives him to write down notes about everything he learns in regards to heroes' Quirks and fighting capabilities.</p> </li>
              
              <li><p>Thanks to this practice, Izuku has developed a great analytical mind and can form complex battle plans in a few seconds,
                  <br> factoring in the best ways to use his Quirk.</p></li>
              
              <li><p>Izuku is known to help or lecture people with personal and emotional problems, regardless if it's his business or not, 
                  <br>claiming that a hero should meddle in other people's lives.</p></li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2> ✨ <u>Abilities</u></h2>
        <img class="flow" src="Images/Flow of One for All.gif">
        <ol>

            <li> <h4> Trained Muscles </h4></li>
            <p> 
                Usage of One For All requires the user to have strong muscles, as One For All is a lot to handle and  
                <br>
                could cause the user's body to be blown apart. Deku diligently trains his muscles every day and becomes physically stronger throughout the series. 
                <br>
                He is often seen running laps and using dumbbells or grippers to train during his free time.
                <br>
                Deku can also be observed doing the air chair exercise during the breaks between classes.
            </p>
                <img class="shootstyle" src="Images/Shoot Style.gif">
            <li><h4> Immense Stamina</h4></li>
            <p>
                Izuku has shown on many occasions that he is capable of handling large amounts of pain.Such times were mostly side-effects of overusing 
                <br> his Quirk and frequently led to various broken bones.
                <br>
                Izuku is able to avoid those repercussions by staying in a safe range of One For All power output (currently, this is around 45%).
                <br>
                Should he be forced to output more power, Izuku is still capable of fighting decently even with broken limbs thanks to the effects of adrenaline, but will succumb to exhaustion a while later.
                <br>
                After multiple months of hard work and training with the No. 1 Pro Hero Endeavor, Izuku has become much sturdier and 
                <br>
                resilient when it comes to the drawbacks of his Quirk, allowing him to withstand the recoil from 100% attacks without being instantly incapacitated.
            </p>

            <li> <h4> Immense speed</h4></li>
            <p>
                Izuku possesses great reflexes with and without Full Cowl. He can react in time to defend from Shoto's ice which has been shown to occur in the literal blink of an eye  
                <br>
                and can keep up with Katsuki's movements in their first fight.
                <br>
                At 100% his speed rises to levels rivaling or even surpassing that of All Might, which allows him to casually blitz capable villains and move several times faster than the eye can see. 
                <br>
                During his fight with Overhaul, he could completely out-speed the villain and move fast enough to create afterimages, and later completely overwhelm him with an instantaneous rush of punches.
            </p>

            <li> <h4> Leadership Skills</h4></li>
            <p>
                As a natural consequence of his bravery and strategic mindset, Izuku has displayed incredible leadership skills on various occasions.
                <br>
                By the start of his U.A. life, Izuku had already earned the trust of Ochaco Uraraka and Tenya thanks to his actions in the U.A. Entrance Exam, 
                <br>
                which was enough to allow him to be voted class representative early on (having relinquished the position to Tenya shortly after).
            </p>

            <li> <h4> Adaptability</h4></li>
            <p>
                Thanks to his analytical abilities, Izuku is able to replicate the techniques of others. For example, after training with Gran Torino and 
                <br>
                gaining minor mastery of One For All, Izuku was able to duplicate Katsuki's moves during a training exercise. 
                <br>
                After training and drawing inspiration from his classmate, Tsuyu Asui, Izuku has become proficient enough with Blackwhip to 
                <br>
                generate a dark tendril from his tongue, allowing him to replicate her "Froppy Style" combat.

        <h1> <center><span class="quirks">Quirks</span></center></h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>A Quirk (個こ性せい Kosei, lit. "Individuality"), formerly known as a Meta Ability 
                <br>(異い能のう Inō?, lit. "Extraordinary Ability"), is a superhuman ability that a person can possess.</p></li>
            <li><p>Along with being unique to each user, Quirks are sorted into multiple categories.</p></li>
            <li><p> Quirk users are also limited to only developing one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other through natural means.</p></li>
            <li><p>Quirks are said to be the next stage of evolution in the human race. It is possible, though rudimentary, to diagnose a person as possessing or 
                <br>lacking a Quirk by analyzing the presence or absence of an extra joint in their pinky toe.</p></li>
            <li><p>. People with only one joint tend to develop a Quirk, while having two joints usually indicates that the person is Quirkless.</p></li>
            <li><p>While Quirks are unique from person to person, some powers are more common and widespread than others, such as 
                <br>fire or water manipulation and the power to grow to gigantic sizes. On the other hand, Quirks such as spatial warping and regenerative healing are very rare.</p></li>
        </ul>

                <ul>
                 <li><p>Transferred to him from Toshinori Yagi, Izuku's Quirk allows him to stockpile an enormous amount of raw power, 
                  allowing him to significantly enhance all of his physical abilities to a superhuman level. </p></li>

                 <li><p>The Quirk grants Deku unbelievable levels of strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability.</p></li>

                 <li><p>Izuku can focus the stockpiled power into a single body part, or spread it across his entire body evenly, 
                 <br>though, focusing the power in a single part puts a greater strain on that part of his body.</p> </li>

                 <li><p>The Quirk factors of the previous power holders have merged with the core of One For All 
                    <br>and have drastically increased in strength since.</p></li>

                 <li><p>This grants Izuku the ability to access and utilize the Quirks of the previous holders of One For All.</p></li>

                 <li><p>He can even use more than one of these assimilated Quirks at a time, granting him even more options in battle. </p></li>

            <p> The Quirk of the third user. This Quirk allows Izuku to build up and store kinetic energy as he moves.

            <p> The Quirk of the fourth user, Hikage Shinomori. This Quirk allows Izuku to detect threats in the surrounding area. 
               <br> Due to the amplification of One For All, the detection causes a stabbing sensation in his head and it takes a toll on his body.
